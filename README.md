# GlobalWarmingModel

This folders contains the scripts and function I worte in Python attending the online lesson from Prof David Archer form University of michigan about Global Warming modeling. The lessons can be found on coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-warming-model/home/welcome .

## Description of the files 

### Naked Planet

This file model the time dependant temperature of a planet filled with water, where on can change several parameters. This is an easy mode to have a first estimation of equilibrium temperature on a planar system. 

### Snowball

This is a model which goes a little bit further the Naked planet one where we consider a possible change between water to ice when albeod and temperature change. There you can vary differnet parameters and analised the evolution of equilibrium temperature and ice formation for differnt albedos.

### Ice Sheet Flow

This is a model of how an ice sheet can develop over time assuming a flat ground. This is a first model to understand ice sheet formation. Note: on spyder the animation does not work.

### Shallow Water 

This is a model for the ocean stream movement taking into account the Coriolis effect. Note: on spyder the animation does not work. This model is based on a template provided during the lessons. All the other scripts are selfmade by myself.

### Near Future 

This is a model for CO2 emission and temperature raised looking at two simulations, business as usual if we continue as we are doing or without human where we stop to emit CO2 at a certain year. 

## used package 

As this is not a package, I do not provide a renv file. However just three packages has been used : mathplotlib, numpy and math
